The SLU Main library has grown enormously into a massive building—the six storey Msgr. Vath Library Building in Bonifacio Campus. Towering over the other buildings in the SLU main campus and resembling the big heart of the early CICM fathers and sisters who gave the people of the Cordillera and Northern Luzon quality Catholic education, the library building now houses a varied collection of print, non-print, electronic and internet-based resources.

Today, the Saint Louis University (SLU) Libraries have expanded with a satellite library named Devesse Library in Maryheights Campus.

With the ongoing computerization and reorganization, the SLU Libraries are set to meet the challenges of library preservation and conservation, automation, collaboration and networking endeavor.
